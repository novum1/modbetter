A two-container garage is a structure composed of two shipping containers set side by side with one long wall removed from each container.

This unique garage design measures 40 ft by 24 ft, making it suitable for cargo containers. The primary factor to consider when selecting a shipping container garage style is the number of vehicles you intend to store in the car garage and the ease of movement in and out of the garage.

The typical shipping container cost is usually between $2000 and $4500, which is an important factor to consider when planning to build your own [container garage](https://modbetter.com/shipping-container-garages/).

Constructing a two-container garage involves choosing the right containers, determining the best orientation and layout, and making necessary modifications and customizations. Let’s explore these aspects in detail.

### Choosing the Right Containers

When selecting shipping containers for your garage, choosing the appropriate size and type is essential. The two most common sizes of shipping containers employed for garages are 20 feet and 40 feet. The standard width and height of shipping containers are approximately 8 feet and 8-9 feet, respectively, making them a durable container garage option.

In addition to size and type, you must decide whether to purchase a new or used container. Buying a new shipping container is more expensive but has a longer lifespan, making it a suitable choice for a shipping container shop. If you opt for a used container, be sure to check for signs of rust and fissures before making your purchase.

### Orientation and Layout

Several layout options are available for arranging two shipping containers, such as side-by-side, end-to-end, or parallel, with space in between. When orienting and laying out shipping containers for a garage, it is advisable to select the design and configuration that best suits the purpose of the garage. Additionally, it is suggested to construct a foundation, pick the appropriate container size and type, and correctly grade the site to direct moisture away from the foundation.

Two potential solutions exist for creating a shipping container carport: employing a single container with a roof affixed to adjacent posts or utilizing two containers with a roof positioned between them. Both options provide the necessary shelter and protection for your vehicles while maximizing the available space.

### Modifications and Customizations

Certain modifications are typically required to transform two shipping containers into a functional garage. These include removing walls, installing garage doors, and reinforcing the structure. Removing the long walls from each container creates a larger, more accessible space for vehicles and storage. Installing garage doors in place of heavy container doors improves ease of use and safety.

When joining two shipping containers, it is crucial to reinforce the connection areas, which may necessitate welding or specific tools. Hiring an expert is advised to guarantee structural integrity.

By making these modifications and customizations, you’ll be well on your way to creating the perfect two-container garage for your needs.

## Advantages of a Two Shipping Container Garage

There are several advantages to utilizing shipping containers for a garage, such as fast construction, simple assembly, and cost-effectiveness. A two-container garage, in particular, offers increased storage space, design flexibility, and cost-efficiency. You can store up to four cars using two shipping containers, showcasing one of the many shipping container garage ideas.

In the following sections, we will delve deeper into the benefits of a two-container garage, discussing how it provides increased storage space, flexibility in design, and cost-effectiveness compared to traditional garages.

### Increased Storage Space

One of the most significant advantages of a two-container garage is its increased storage space. With two shipping containers, you have more room for tools, equipment, and vehicles, allowing you to keep your garage organized and tidy.

A two-container garage can accommodate up to six vehicles, making it a great option for creating a container carport. The additional storage space in a two-container garage also facilitates the garage’s organization and tidiness.

### Flexibility in Design

Another advantage of a two-container garage is the design flexibility it offers. With two containers, you have the ability to arrange them in various configurations and customize the garage according to your specific needs. This adaptability allows for easy modification of the layout or size of the garage, making it suitable for different requirements and scenarios.

Moreover, a two-container garage is more cost-efficient and portable than traditional garages. A two-container garage can be arranged in a single or double-container layout or a combination of containers and other materials. Additionally, it can be customized with features like shelving, work benches, and overhead storage. This design flexibility sets a two-container garage apart from other storage container solutions.

### Cost-Effectiveness

A two-container garage is a cost-effective alternative to traditional construction methods. Building a 24ft by 20ft garage with three 20ft used containers for a DIYer would cost approximately $6000. This amount covers the price of the containers. Including additional items such as a garage door, concrete for piers, and joining metal would bring the total to around $7500. Steel building kits come at a lower cost than most other construction materials. For example, a similar-sized kit would cost about $5500 plus an additional $2000 for a concrete slab foundation.

The cost savings of a two-container garage, combined with its increased storage space and design flexibility, make it an attractive option for those looking to build a garage on a budget. With proper planning and execution, a two-container garage can provide all the benefits of a traditional garage without breaking the bank.
