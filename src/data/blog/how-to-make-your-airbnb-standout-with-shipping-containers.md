## Creating Instagram-worthy experiences

With millions of listings on Airbnb’s platform, making sure your property stands out from the crowd is tough.

Travelers have high expectations, and they’re looking for a unique experience they can’t find anywhere else.

[**Modified shipping containers**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6NGRLLD9UU) can be transformed into living spaces and amenities that attract more bookings, increase your revenue, and ultimately create a memorable experience for your guests.

Shipping containers are cost-effective, eco-friendly, and easy to modify, with endless design possibilities.

This article will discuss how to make your Airbnb stand out with three main amenities: shipping container pools, guest houses, and garages.

Once you finish reading, explore our [**shipping container products**](https://modbetter.com/use-cases/) and schedule a consultation to upgrade your Airbnb listings.

### Introducing Modified Shipping Containers

Shipping containers are designed specifically for transportation purposes but have become popular in various industries due to their versatility and durability.

Modified shipping containers have become beautiful living spaces offering modern amenities while maintaining their industrial aesthetic.

In addition, using shipping containers as a building material is eco-friendly. They repurpose existing materials instead of using new ones like traditional building methods require.

Moreover, they’re customizable, allowing hosts freedom in design.

With modified shipping containers as your unique selling point on Airbnb, you can create a memorable stay at an affordable cost and still be eco-friendly too.

## Advantages of Container Modifications for Airbnb Rentals

### Cost-Effective Compared to Traditional Construction Methods

One of the biggest advantages of using modified shipping containers for your Airbnb rental is the cost-effectiveness.

Compared to traditional construction methods, building with shipping containers can save you a lot of money.

Shipping containers are already designed and built to withstand harsh conditions, making them a durable and solid choice for your rental property.

Another cost-saving factor when using modified shipping containers is that they’re pre-built structures that can be delivered straight to your property.

### Eco-Friendly Option That Repurposes Existing Materials

![Storage Container Garage with Live Plants](/images/blog/ca600a7c-6761-449f-bfc7-146a62d6782d.png)

In today’s world, where sustainability is becoming increasingly important, using modified shipping containers for your Airbnb listing is an excellent eco-friendly option.

Rather than starting from scratch with new materials, modifying existing shipping containers repurposes materials that would otherwise go unused, minimizing waste and reducing your carbon footprint.

Additionally, recycling existing shipping containers reduces the need to cut down trees or use cement in construction projects.

The reduction in consumption of these non-renewable resources makes it a more sustainable option overall.

### Modular Design Allows for Easy Customization and Scalability

Modified shipping container rentals offer flexibility in design to fit any vision one might have.

Because they’re designed as modular, you can put individual units together and add or remove wall sections as needed.

The modular design also allows scalability; if business takes off and you wish to expand your Airbnb offering later on – adding more units or additional floors becomes easier than traditional construction methods.

## Shipping Container Pools: Let’s Dive In

![Storage Container Pool](/images/blog/159c5151-c92b-42b6-86cd-c2435c6c3bd0.png)

### What is a shipping container pool?

If you’re looking for a unique, eye-catching feature to add to your Airbnb property, a shipping container pool may be just the thing. As the name suggests, these pools are made from recycled shipping containers.

They’re typically customized to fit into small spaces and can be equipped with features like heating and lighting. Because they’re made of steel, they offer durability and resistance against harsh weather conditions.

### How shipping container pools help your Airbnb stand out

Adding a shipping container pool to your Airbnb property can instantly make it stand out from the rest. These pools offer several benefits that traditional in-ground pools don’t have.

First and foremost, they’re fun! Everyone from toddlers to grandparents loves splashing around the pool. Setting up something like a basketball hoop or volleyball net makes the experience even better.

Also, they’re portable. If you ever decide to sell your property or move on from hosting an Airbnb, you can easily take your pool with you.

Another advantage of using a shipping container pool is the customization options available. You can work with specialists to help design and build a full custom storage container pool that meets all your needs – size, shape, depth, color, and style.

### Tips for installing a shipping container pool on your property

![Rooftop sunny space](/images/blog/406f42ab-1d7b-4e4b-b578-7e538425b9c6.png)

Before adding a shipping container pool to your Airbnb rental space, you’ll need to find a reputable company like **[ModPools](https://modpools.com/)** that’s able to do the job perfectly.

Unlike other types of swimming pool installation, this requires high-level knowledge of structural engineering.

Shipping container pools need reinforcement so they won’t crack due to heavy loads or movements. Permits must also be obtained by applying through local government offices as required by law.

Once these requirements have been met, then designing begins where choosing the right size (depending on how much space is available), shape and color of the pool is important to match the style of your Airbnb property.

Also, consider additional features such as heating, lighting, and water filtration that can be included in the design. This custom design should take into account what kind of activities guests will be able to enjoy in the pool space so it can accommodate their needs too.

Overall, shipping container pools offer a unique and exciting way to add value and curb appeal to your Airbnb property. With the right planning and resources in hand, you’ll be able to make your property stand out from the competition while providing a memorable experience for your guests!

## Real-life use case

![](/images/blog/Container-Airbnb-1024x691.jpeg)

Airbnb host Isaac French recently added a [**shipping container pool**](https://twitter.com/isaacfrench_/status/1660660753496432640?s=20) to his “moat” of amenities at **[Live Oak Lake](https://linktr.ee/liveoaklake).**

His main goal is to craft beautiful, unique experiences for his guests that they can’t wait to share with their friends on Instagram and TikTok.

The entire process took about two months from start to finish. He was able to pour a simple concrete slab while he waited for his delivery, then rented a large forklift and unloaded it himself once it arrived on the truck.

**Here’s a full breakdown of his costs:**

- Pool cost: $58,000
- Concrete: $5,000
- Electrical: $2,500
- Deck w/railing: $17,700
- Pool furniture, signage, etc: $2,000
- **Total cost = $85,200**

He raised rates $45 across all seven listings (with no slowdown in bookings) and expects it to pay for itself within nine months.

- **$45\*7 = $315**
- **$85,200/$315 = 271 nights (9 mo)**

One tip Isaac gave was to make sure to account for maintenance. The container pool requires about 1 hr/week, straining leaves, cleaning filter, etc.

Also, liability insurance added $1,000 to his annual policy.

## The Benefits of Guest Houses for Your Airbnb

![Container Guest House](/images/blog/5c70ed0e-c071-4aee-a7ee-54d0d6cfce5a.png)

Guest houses can be a great addition to any property. Whether it’s your home or the one you rent out on Airbnb.

A guest house is a small standalone building that’s designed to provide guests with a private space separate from the main house. They’re one of the few amenities you’ll never find at a hotel.

Benefits include:

- **Increased Privacy:** A guest house allows guests to have their own private space away from the family or main house, allowing them to feel more comfortable during their stay.
- **More Space:** If your Airbnb property doesn’t have enough rooms for multiple guests, a guest house can be an excellent way to provide additional sleeping quarters without sacrificing comfort or privacy.
- **Increased Cash Flow:** Adding a guest house to your property can significantly increase monthly revenue. You can even rent them out as a **[standalone listing](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/3697605?source_impression_id=p3_1686684447_jm4CBAydpUePWSPY)** like this host from Novato, California.

## Types of Guest Houses

![Bright guest house with yellow paint](/images/blog/79f27eb8-1023-4996-b82c-5ff1dc24e08d.png)

There are two main types of guest houses: detached and attached. Detached guest houses are standalone buildings separate from the property’s main house.

These structures can range from small cottages to full-sized homes, depending on the available space on your property. Attached guest houses are structures that are connected or adjacent to the main house on the property.

They may share some utilities or common areas with the main home but still offer some degree of privacy. When deciding which type of guest house is right for your Airbnb, you’ll want to consider factors like available space and zoning regulations in your area.

## Designing and Furnishing Your Guest House

![Guest house with double doors](/images/blog/8932063b-9e54-453e-89f6-273de59618e7.png)

Once you’ve decided on what type of guest house you’re going to build to make your Airbnb stand out, it’s time to focus on designing and furnishing it for maximum comfort and curb appeal.

Here are some tips:

- **Keep it Simple:** While you should aim to create a comfortable and inviting space, it’s important not to go overboard with the design.

  Stick to simple, neutral colors and furniture that will appeal to a wide range of guests.

- **Provide Amenities:** To make your guest house feel like a home away from home, be sure to provide amenities like fresh linens, toiletries, and basic kitchen supplies.

  Wi-Fi is also a must for most travelers.

- **Consider the Outdoors:** If your guest house has an outdoor area, consider adding some comfortable seating or a small table and chairs so guests can enjoy the outdoors and natural light during their stay.

  By following these tips, you can create a complete guest house that will add value to your Airbnb property and keep guests coming back time and time again.

## Shipping Container Garages

### Converting Extra Space into a Functional Garage

Shipping containers are made from corrugated steel and offer a durable and secure solution for exterior storage sheds, additional garage space, or hobbyist workshops.

They can also be leveraged to enhance your Airbnb property’s appeal and provide guests with extra amenities. Garages can be transformed into living spaces, game rooms, workout areas, or even movie theaters.

By doing so, you’re providing guests with more options for entertainment and relaxation during their stay.

This means you can accommodate more guests comfortably and charge more per night. **This host in Arizona expects to clear an extra** [**$3K per month**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IewSAQ8VU28) **from his garage alone!**

Like guest houses, garages also provide privacy for guests who may want some alone time away from the house’s main living area.

### Different Ways Garages Can Be Converted

![Living space container modifications](/images/blog/87fdc0d8-4f4f-4355-a493-2b80622d812c.png)

If you plan on using the converted space as a bedroom or living room, consider adding insulation to the walls and ceiling for optimal temperature control and soundproofing.

Air conditioning and proper ventilation are also a must-have for those hot summer months.

You can also add windows or skylights for natural lighting and stargazing experiences that your guest’s whole family will enjoy.

If you’re looking to add game rooms or entertainment areas, consider installing speakers and recessed lighting for an immersive experience.

Pool tables, big-screen TVs, and beer coolers are perfect options if you’re looking to appeal to bachelor parties or golf trips.

Add comfortable seating arrangements such as bean bag chairs or couches for lounging.

If fitness is your focus, install gym equipment such as weights, yoga mats, or cardio machines. A mini fridge stocked with water bottles adds a nice personal touch and keeps guests hydrated during their workouts.

### Making Sure Your Converted Garage Meets Building Codes and Safety Regulations

![Garage container modifications with shelving and car space](/images/blog/056838b9-85a3-4d62-bad6-df43471b4213.png)

Make sure that all necessary permits are obtained through local government channels before starting work on any conversion project(s).

Once completed, it’s important to have these projects inspected so they meet current safety and compliance standards before renting them out as living spaces.

Be sure to have all the necessary electrical work done and make sure that everything is up to code.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your garage conversion is both safe and appealing to guests.

## Marketing your modified shipping container Airbnb rental

### Highlighting the unique features and benefits in your listing description

Once your modified shipping container Airbnb is up and running, it’s time to market it to potential guests.

The first step in marketing is creating a listing description that highlights your rental’s unique features and benefits.

When writing your listing description, be sure to emphasize the special features and eco-friendly practices you’ve incorporated into the interior design.

It’s also important to include information about the location of your rental.

Is it close to popular attractions or nestled in a quiet neighborhood? Let potential customers and guests know what makes your location special.

### Utilizing high-quality photos that showcase the design and amenities

![Bright outdoor seating with storage container roof](/images/blog/4ed1f4f4-fb5b-4e11-9b42-e2b84f6a6979.png)

In addition to a compelling listing description, high-quality photos are essential for attracting guests to your modified shipping container Airbnb rental site.

Make sure to take plenty of photos from different angles to give potential guests an accurate sense of what it looks like inside and out.

Be sure to showcase any unique amenities or design features in your photos as well.

For example, if you’ve incorporated reclaimed wood or other eco-friendly materials into the design, ensure those elements are highlighted somehow.

### Offering special promotions or packages to attract guests

Offering special promotions or service packages can be a great way to attract more guests and stand out from other rentals in your area.

Consider offering discounts for longer stays or bundling additional amenities like bike rentals or free guided tours with each booking.

You could also consider partnering with local businesses such as restaurants or spas for joint promotional offers – this helps attract more bookings and support small businesses within the community!

Don’t be afraid to get creative with your promotions in order to make your short-term rental stand out.
