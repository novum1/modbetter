Are you considering building a modular office space? Whether you’re an entrepreneur seeking a cost-effective, flexible solution or a business owner looking for a portable office to house your employees while the building’s under construction, shipping container offices offer numerous benefits over traditional brick-and-mortar ones.

Read on to learn the top eight benefits of shipping containers as offices below, then find out more about our [**custom shipping containers**](https://modbetter.com/) at ModBetter. We can tailor a shipping container office to your company’s exact needs.

## 1. Cost-Effective and Eco-Friendly

Shipping container offices begin with cargo-worthy containers that make the entire build process more cost-effective. The job-site build offers operational efficiency for reduced labor costs, while the cargo containers cut down on building materials.

Office containers are also environmentally friendly. Finding sustainable solutions for your business isn’t always easy, but modular offices use recycled materials that can reduce your company’s carbon footprint, reflecting well on your business.

The cost savings and eco-friendly benefits go beyond the initial build. Storage container offices offer excellent energy efficiency, allowing you to save on your power bill each month.

## 2. Offers the Ideal Environment for Focus

The perfect office provides a quiet, cool, relaxing space with minimal distractions where your team can work hard all day.

A shipping container office space can increase productivity by creating the ideal ambiance for your team. The modular construction prevents distractions that employees typically experience in larger expansive buildings and allows for easy flexibility to move offices around whenever someone needs a fresh perspective.

## 3. Shipping Container Offices Are Spacious

Manufacturers create shipping containers to maximize every square foot of space. While they may seem compact on the outside, you’ll find the interior feels spacious, inviting, and full of opportunity. With the additional interior space, you can create multiple rooms or offices within one office container or combine multiple containers together for modular office spaces.

## 4. Provides Endless Customization Options

A shipping container office is a blank canvas. You can create anything you dream of, which makes shipping containers as offices incredibly appealing.

Whether you envision a modern, sleek office with high-tech features or something more quaint and unique to welcome customers and celebrate your vibe, your construction and design team can make it happen. Shipping container office customization includes exterior color and finishes, interior design, windows, flooring options, unique layouts, and more.

## 5. Top-Notch Durability and Security

Mobile offices built from a shipping container use the highest quality and most durable construction materials, built to withstand nearly anything. [**Shipping container offices**](https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/how-modern-day-shipping-container-changed-world.html) can stand strong against extreme hail, tornado-force winds, heavy rain, constant snowfall, and more. You won’t have to worry about replacing shingles or siding after every major storm like you would with a brick-and-mortar office.

## 6. Convenient Location Flexibility

Manufacturers make shipping containers to be portable. If your office needs to move locations, you won’t have an issue. Shipping container offices provide ideal location flexibility so you can jet-set around the nation expanding your company.

## 7. Works as a Temporary or Permanent Solution

You can create a shipping box office as your permanent workspace or as a temporary solution for construction sites. If you’re doing construction on your main building, you can use the ground-level office space to keep your team productive with additional space.

## 8. Fast Build Times

Build teams can construct a container office directly on job sites or at their construction facility before transporting, offering fast build times. With this decreased construction time, your team can get to work sooner. Understand the benefits of shipping containers as offices!
