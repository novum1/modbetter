    <h1>About ModBetter</h1>

    <p>
      ModBetter is a resource for people interested in shipping container
      conversions. We cover garages, offices, coffee shops, restaurants,
      man caves, and other container projects.

    <p>
      Our guides focus on practical information: real costs, what permits
      you need, foundation requirements, and lessons from actual projects.
